This repo contains an example C code for the Analog Discovery 2 that sweeps the programmable power supply voltage
across a diode, and also measures the voltage across a series resistance to yield the current. The voltage and calculated
current information are output to a file and can be plotted in gnuplot with the file in the repo. With default installation 
of Waveforms software, compile code as per:

g++ diodeCurveTracer.cpp -o diodeCurveTracer.o -I /usr/include/digilent/waveforms -l dwf
